            <h3>About Food</h3>
            <p>Food, substance consisting essentially of protein, carbohydrate, fat, and other nutrients used in the
                body of an
                organism to sustain growth and vital processes and to furnish energy. The absorption and utilization of
                food by the body
                is fundamental to nutrition and is facilitated by digestion. Plants, which convert solar energy to food
                by
                photosynthesis, are the primary food source. Animals that feed on plants often serve as sources of food
                for other
                animals. To learn more about the sequence of transfers of matter and energy in the form of food from
                organism to
                organism, see food chain.</p>
